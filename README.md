FlaskTemplate
=============
Simple Flask template for creating new projects. Very bare bones, but a good starting point to build on.

Includes basic setup for WTForm and Flask-SQLAlchemy (with migrations). 

Config file included, but should be removed for real projects. Database config files included too. Delete migrate file and run db_create.py to create new db repository.

Uses basic bootstrap template. Edit as needed.
